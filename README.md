# Virtual Reality Research

## Brief Description:
This is my senior research project. The research is focused on using virtual reality to improve computer science education. The JavaScript program generated a dynamic virtaul reality enviroment that the user can click through to see how the memory is impacted by each part of a code snippet. A full description can be found in the CS 499 Paper.pdf file in this repository.

## Usage
First you will need to have React360 and Node.js set up on your machine to start this program. The following link provides the information to install these. https://facebook.github.io/react-360/docs/setup.html Once you have have executed the command "cd Hello36", you will need to move client.js, index.js, and store.js from this github repository into that directory. Then you will start program execution with the following command:
  npm start
In your web browser, paste this url, http://localhost:8081/index.html. This may take a couple minutes to compile and load the first time. 
Once the virtaul reality enviroment has loaded, you can step forwards and backwards through the code snippet using the "Next" and "Back" buttons on the top-center panel.
