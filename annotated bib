Maloney, John, et al. Programming by Choice: Urban Youth Learning Programming with Scratch . web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/sigcse-08.pdf. -Focuses on CS/programming education outside of the classroom since this is at a local center where learning opportunity is accessible but learning happens from youth's motivation
-9% of time of youth is spent in an formal educational institution and then that time is divided among many subjects
-Scratch is drag nad drop instead of typing code
-Scratch focuses on animations and media manipulation
-Scratch includes a lot of core programming concepts
-Scratch has sprite variables and global variables
-Clubhouse hosted 3-4 hour ScratchAThons
-Scratch heavily and successfully boys and girls of color
-most associated school subject to Scratch was Arts with 20 then reading with 10
-Students were able to express their vcreativity
-A lot of kids didnt know what computer programming was after using scratch
-Kids learned CS concepts on their own with the occasional mentors (w/o programming experience) that are available
-Kelleher, C. &amp; Pausch, R. (2005). have researxch on lowering barriersa by simplifying ideas an dimproving motivation

-intro CS classes focus on easy, isolated, small problems
-real world CS operates in bigger framework
-electrical engineers aren't given a good enough understanding of CS
-consumer single user VR devices v projection based expensive VR devices
-Creating a 3D scene gives students a challenge and an opportunity to be creative
-students engage with a complex library while workung with VR
-engaging with VR greatly increased students'interest in programming
